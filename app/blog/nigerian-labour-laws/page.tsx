              <p>As an HR professional in Nigeria, having a solid grasp of labour laws is non-negotiable. HR professionals manage recruitment, termination, compensation, workplace disputes etc.   Understanding the legal framework governing employment helps you protect your organisation and its employees.</p>

              <p>Let's break down key Nigerian labour laws every HR professional must be familiar with in 2025.</p>

              <h2>1. The Labour Act (2004) – The Foundation</h2>
              <p>The Nigerian Labour Act is the cornerstone of labour regulation. While it mostly applies to low to mid-level employees (non-executives), it outlines the basic terms and conditions of employment, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Minimum wage requirements</li>
                <li>Working hours (typically 40 hours/week)</li>
                <li>Overtime rules</li>
                <li>Sick leave and annual leave entitlements</li>
                <li>Termination procedures</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always draft employment contracts in line with the Labour Act. Include clauses on leave, working hours, and termination to avoid disputes.</p>

              <h2>2. Employee Compensation Act (2010)</h2>
              <p>This Act mandates employers to provide compensation to employees who suffer injuries, diseases, or death in the course of employment.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Provisions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Employers must register with the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF)</li>
                <li>Compensation covers medical treatment, disability, and dependents of deceased employees</li>
                <li>Applies to both private and public sector employees</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure your organization is registered with the NSITF and that your employees know how to report workplace injuries.</p>

              <h2>3. National Minimum Wage Act</h2>
              <p>The current national minimum wage in Nigeria is ₦70,000/month, States or sectors' minimum wage may vary but no employer is permitted to pay below this threshold.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure all employees, including contract staff and interns, are paid at or above the minimum wage as non-compliance can lead to serious penalties.</p>

              <h2>4. Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes Act</h2>
              <p>This law governs the registration of trade unions and the resolution of industrial disputes.</p>
              <p><strong>HR Responsibilities:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Allow employees to freely join or form trade unions</li>
                <li>Engage in collective bargaining where necessary</li>
                <li>Follow due process before dismissing unionized staff</li>
                <li>Handle strikes in compliance with the law</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Foster open dialogue between management and union leaders to prevent escalations.</p>

              <h2>5. Pensions Reform Act (2014)</h2>
              <p>The Act makes pension contributions mandatory for employers with more than 3 employees.</p>
              <p><strong>Contribution Breakdown:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Employer: Minimum of 10% of monthly salary</li>
                <li>Employee: Minimum of 8%</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Remit pension contributions monthly to employees' Retirement Savings Accounts (RSA) via a licensed PFA (Pension Fund Administrator).</p>

              <h2>6. Personal Income Tax Act (PITA)</h2>
              <p>As an HR lead, you're responsible for deducting Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax from employee salaries and remitting to the appropriate state Inland Revenue Service.</p>

              <h2>7. The Factories Act</h2>
              <p>If your company operates in a manufacturing or production setting, this law applies.</p>
              <p>It covers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Workplace safety standards</li>
                <li>Provision of protective equipment</li>
                <li>Clean working environment</li>
                <li>Medical examinations</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Regularly conduct health and safety audits and ensure compliance with the Ministry of Labour guidelines.</p>

              <h2>8. Maternity and Paternity Leave Laws</h2>
              <p>Under the Labour Act:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Female employees are entitled to at least 12 weeks of maternity leave (6 before and 6 after delivery), with at least 50% pay.</li>
                <li>Paternity leave is not yet officially recognized under federal law, but some states (e.g., Lagos, Enugu) grant up to 10 days of paternity leave.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Offer competitive and inclusive leave policies to support employee wellbeing and attract top talent.</p>

              <h2>9. Termination and Redundancy Laws</h2>
              <p>Termination must follow due process, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Issuing proper notice or payment in lieu</li>
                <li>Providing severance packages where applicable</li>
                <li>Avoiding unfair dismissal (e.g., based on gender, religion, or union membership)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep documentation for every disciplinary action or performance issue to avoid legal pitfalls if termination arises.</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>Labour law compliance is a core HR responsibility. Staying updated helps you:</p>
